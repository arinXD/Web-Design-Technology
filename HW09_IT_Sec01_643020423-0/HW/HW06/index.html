            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Chris Bumstead is from Ottawa, Canada.
                As a kid, he looked up to the legendary Tom Platz because of his iconic leg development. He also cited
                Barry Demay (80s bodybuilder) as one his inspirations, and, of course, the great Arnold Schwarzenegger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bumstead built the base of his physique training for sports that he was involved with in high school
                such as football, basketball and ran track and field.
                He was introduced to bodybuilding through his sister’s boyfriend (now husband) Iain Valliere, who is
                also an IFBB Professional bodybuilder. Valliere saw potential in Bumstead and helped him to prepare for
                his competition in 2014, when he was just 19 years old. He has acknowledged Valliere as being someone
                he’s inspired by and who he still looks up to.
                Bumstead really found his home in the Classic Physique division and it seems he wouldn’t want to be
                anywhere else.
            </p>
            <h3>Competition and Career</h3>
            <p>
                Bumstead first competed in 2014 at age 19, and then at just 21 years old, earned his Pro Card after
                winning the 2016 IFBB North American Bodybuilding Championships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bumstead is the current <a class="link-in-p" target="_blank"
                    href="https://fitnessvolt.com/2020-olympia-classic-physique-results/">Classic Physique Olympia
                    champion</a> , a title he won in 2019, 2020 and 2021. He was
                the runner-up at the same competition in 2017 and 2018 to Breon Ansley which was definitely frustrating
                for him. However, he brought an amazing package in 2019, which earned him the first place trophy at the
                biggest competition in the world. His 2019 Olympia win was impressive considering <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://fitnessvolt.com/chris-bumstead-hernia-surgery-olympia/" class="link-in-p">he had
                    hernia surgery</a>
                months out from the show.
            <p>
                As of right now, there’s no telling what the future of the Classic Physique division will look like, but
                Bumstead is likely not looking to give up his crown anytime soon.
            </p>
            <h3>Chris Bumstead Training Regime</h3>
            <p>
                Because of the health crisis situation in 2020, Bumstead <a class="link-in-p" target="_blank"
                    href="https://fitnessvolt.com/chris-bumstead-home-gym/">trained at his home for several months
                    as did
                    many competitors</a> , although he was able to eventually return to the gym.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bumstead’s workouts vary and that’s because bodybuilders typically tweak their training routines for
                many reasons. They have an off-season, contest prep, and not to mention, changing things up prevents
                boredom and it can elicit a new stimulus.
                Bumstead changes his splits every now and then and an example of one of his splits looks something like
                quads, arms and shoulders, hamstrings, back, and chest on their own days.
                He also uses drop sets and super sets in his training which are very effective muscle-building methods.

            <h3>About Jay Cutler</h3>
            <p>
                Jay Cutler (born Jason Isaac Cutler on August 3, 1973, in Sterling, Massachusetts) is an American IFBB
                professional bodybuilder. He is a four time Mr. Olympia winner (2006, 2007, 2009 & 2010).
            </p>
            <p>
                Cutler worked in his family’s concrete construction business, Cutler Bros Concrete, from the age of 11,
                and began training when he was 18 years old as a senior at Wachusett Regional High School.

                He graduated from Quinsigamond Community College in 1993 with a degree in criminal justice, intending to
                work as a Corrections Officer for a maximum security prison.

                He was inspired to enter bodybuilding after meeting personal trainer Marcos Rodriguez. Cutler excelled
                in bodybuilding, desiring to be one of the largest competitors ever and took his first overall win in
                1993 at the Iron Bodies Invitational.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cutler won the Olympia for a second consecutive year in 2007. Jay Cutler became the third Mr. Olympia in
                history (along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu) to win the title in nonconsecutive years,
                and, defeating the reigning champion <a href="https://fitnessvolt.com/dexter-jackson-profile/"
                    target="_blank" class="link-in-p">Dexter Jackson</a> in 2009, became the only Mr. Olympia in history
                to
                reclaim the title after having competed as title-holder and not won. In 2010, he won his fourth Mr.
                Olympia title, defeating Phil Heath.

            <h3>Jay Cutler Training</h3>
            <div class="plan">
                <p>
                    Jay Cutler was a dominant force in bodybuilding from the early 1990s to 2013. Four-time winner of
                    the Mr. Olympia title, Cutler was a mass monster with great proportions and incredible muscle
                    hardness.In this article, we reveal how Cutler trained to build his phenomenal physique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, he primarily relied on a volume approach to bodybuilding, meaning he did lots of sets of
                    multiple muscle groups per workout. High volume training was popularized by, among others,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://fitnessvolt.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-volume-workout/"
                        class="link-in-p">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and is a widely used method for building muscle
                    mass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cutler was also a very strong bodybuilder and often used very heavy weights in training. However, as
                    he got older and gained even more experience, he came to realize that heavy weights aren’t always
                    best for building muscle and that workout quality is just as important as training poundage.

                At 42-years-old, and around twenty years of experience, Phil Heath will undoubtedly be the perfect
                commentator, since he is familiar with both old-school and modern bodybuilding. Phil also genuinely
                loves the sport, and it is always interesting to hear someone talk about their interest and expertise.

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                Phil Heath is one of the greatest and most accomplished bodybuilders of all time. “The Gift,” as he is
                also known as, has won 7 Mr. Olympia titles in his career. However, things were not always easy for this
                phenomenal athlete, as he had to endure a tough childhood. This experience resulted in giving Heath an
                undeniable drive for success, which he used in his career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phil Heath was born in 1979, in the town of Seattle, Washington. His parents were constantly working to
                provide for their family, so oftentimes Heath was left alone. So due to this, he was forced to learn at
                an early age how to take care of himself. He quickly learned how to cook his own food, while maintaining
                his training for basketball. This hard work is what set him up for a life of success.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was this interest in basketball that first introduced him to weightlifting. Heath would train at his
                school gym to increase his jump height and grew to enjoy the other people he would train with. This
                enjoyment would further develop, as Heath would eventually give up on basketball, not feeling satisfied
                by it anymore. Subsequently, he would return to the weight room, to find his joy.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> Looking back at the journey for Arnold Schwarzenegger to go from
                a young
                and broke Austrian, to bodybuilding legend and Hollywood Icon
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays you would be hard pressed to find a person alive who has not at least heard of Arnold
                Schwarzenegger. However he has not always been a highly beloved Renaissance Man, with global
                recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today we look back at some of the lesser told stories from Arnold himself, and get a better picture of
                what it was like for him to be a young athlete with a big dream and even bigger work ethic.
            </p>

            <h3>Arnold Schwarzenegger Volume Workout Routines</h3>
            <p>
                Arnold Schwarzenegger is a bodybuilding legend. He was and continues to be one of the most
                influential people in the sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Movies like Pumping Iron, Commando, Predator, and the Terminator franchise raised the public’s awareness
                of bodybuilding, and many of today’s bodybuilders owe their careers to Arnie.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has also put his famous name to various bodybuilding and fitness competitions, including the Arnold
                Classic and Arnold Sports Festival. Arnie has put a lot back into the sport that gave him so much.

                But how did Arnold train? What methods did he use to build one of the best physiques in bodybuilding
                history?

                In this article, we reveal a couple of the workouts Arnie used to sculpt his championship-winning
                physique.
            </p>
            <h3>The Early Years Of Arnold Schwarzenegger</h3>
            <p>
                When Arnold Schwarzenegger was growing up, bodybuilding was far from a viable career path. Yet that did
                not stop him from being interested in the sport, even as a young man in Austria.
            </p>
            <p>
                In accordance with the law, he was required to serve in the army at the age of 18, staying in the
                service for a year. It was here, that he started nurturing his desires to be a bodybuilding champion,
                while also displaying the bull-headed nature that he would become known for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arnold voiced his goals to his officers, but they constantly mocked him for wanting to be a bodybuilder.
                Then, he found himself spending a day in jail, when he snuck off the military base, in order to take a
                train to Germany and enter the Junior Mr. Europe.
            </p>
            <h3>Finding Inspiration From Reg Park</h3>
            <p>
                This brief time behind bars did nothing to deter him though, as Arnold Schwarzenegger knew exactly what
                path he wanted to follow. He mapped out his career according to his idol at the time, Reg Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                Park was a two-time winner of the Mr. Universe, and went on to become a bonafide actor, playing the role
                of Hercules in five Italian films. If that sounds familiar, it is because that is quite similar to the
                path that Schwarzenegger took in his career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working to follow the same path as his role model, Arnold set a goal for himself to win the Mr.
                Universe. So he would get to work on bulking up, even sneaking workout equipment to train while he was
                on military exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                This drive would continue as he would workout for hours in the evening, doing pull-ups on tree branches.
                As his time in uniform came to a close, he joined a weightlifting club, where he worked to fully build a
                physique that was worthy of competing.
            </p>
            <h3>No Regrets About Steroid Use</h3>
            <p>
                For a long time, there was a lingering unknown question as to if Arnold Schwarzenegger used any type of
                steroids. It was assumed by many people, but because of the controversial nature of performance
                enhancers, those rumors were unconfirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, that is until Arnie himself admitted to using gear. He had sparingly discussed it on a few
                occasions, but it was an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7035676#.XRD1GehKjIU" target="_blank"
                    class="link-in-p">interview</a> in 2005 that saw the Austrian not only confirm his use, but say that
                he had no regrets about using.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, steroid use was still largely in its infancy at this point, and it was often monitored
                closely. On top of that, it was used in smaller doses, and more infrequently than what you see in
                today’s era of bodybuilding.
            </p>
            <h3>Arnold Schwarzenegger After Dark</h3>
            <p>
                Everyone has their vices, and for Arnold Schwarzenegger it was the devil’s lettuce. When he ran for
                California governor, he did an interview where he admitted that he liked to use marijuana and hash
                during his time in the sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to note that he made it clear that this was the only illicit drug use that he
                participated in. Furthermore, he claimed to forget even doing the interview later on in life, but of the
                use of cannabis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was not the only spicy subject that Arnold discussed in this interview. He also addressed the
                concept of having sex prior to his bodybuilding competitions, something that he fondly admitted to
                doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arnold added that women were often throwing themselves at him, due to the massive size of his physique.
                However he did not feel exploited by these ladies, instead saying some rather disparaging comments about
                these ladies.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day, Arnold Schwarzenegger is not without his controversial moments. On the other
                hand, he has grown into a beloved figure, both in the sport of bodybuilding and the general planet.
